Hi all future users!

18.11.2024 is the birthday of this repository. The goal for today is to
familirise ourselves with all data, scripts and resources provided and
to already begin some work! Firs tho, I will setup a "struct" to contain
data for all fuels we will be using, such that while mixing all info on
constituents are readily available. Fun!
