Github repository for group 35 to collaborate on matlab code in course 4CBLB10:

To collaborate in a fruitful manner, I would like all of us to use the same
coding standards. Please make sure to document your work in the "log.txt"
file. Remember to add comments to every github commit. Finally, please
comment your code and make it clear enough for every member to pick up easily.
